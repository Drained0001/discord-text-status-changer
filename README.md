# discord-text-status-changer
This is technically not a selfbot, but it is. It changes your status and is pretty simple. Feel free to make changes or add pull requests of changes that can be made.

# how to use
You do not have to enter your discord token in the code, you can enter it in terminal when it asks for it.
-
Itll ask for the status you want
-
thats it

# outcome
So say your text status was `Hello World!`
The outcome would be this:
-
`[+] Current discord status: Hello`
-
`[+] Current discord status: Hello World!`
-
and it would repeat from there.
